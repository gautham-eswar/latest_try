       - employment_type (full-time, part-time, contract, internship)

       - responsibilities/achievements (as an array of bullet points)
    5. Education - For each entry, extract:

       - degree (type of degree: BA, BS, MS, PhD, etc.)
       - specialization (major/field of study)

       - date
       - url (if available)
    10. Volunteer Experience - For each position:

    Technical skills include specific tools, technologies, programming languages, and technical methodologies.
    Soft skills include interpersonal abilities, communication skills, character traits, and other leadership skills.

3.  `relevance_score`: Estimate the importance of this keyword for the role on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0 (e.g., 1.0 for required, 0.7 for preferred, 0.5 for mentioned).
4.  `skill_type`: Classify as 'hard skill' (technical, measurable), 'soft skill' (interpersonal), 'qualification' (degree, certificate), 'tool' (software, platform), or 'responsibility'.

IMPORTANT: Ensure the 'keywords' list contains valid JSON objects separated by commas, with no trailing comma after the last object. The entire output MUST be valid JSON.
IMPORTANT: If you cannot extract any meaningful keywords from the text for any reason, you MUST return an empty list like this: {{\\"keywords\\": []}}. DO NOT return conversational text or explanations.
